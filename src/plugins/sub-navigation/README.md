# Sub navigation
## Plugin for [nera](https://github.com/seebaermichi/nera) static site generator
This is a small plugin, which enables a simple sub navigation.

It puts links of sibling pages in the same directory in an array and pushes  
it into the main meta object. After this they can be rendered on each page.
